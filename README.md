cereal - A C++11 library for serialization
==========================================

cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library.  cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON.  cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used standalone.
